# crwn-clothing

## Description
This is a **beautiful and efficient eCommerce application**, akin to Shopify. It's crafted with **React, React Hooks, React Router, Context API, Firebase, styled-components**, and more. The application boasts navigation and routes that guide users through different pages and categories of items. Users can seamlessly add items to their shopping cart by clicking the `'add to cart'` button, which then becomes visible in the cart dropdown menu. Concurrently, the quantity of cart items is promptly updated.

From the cart dropdown, users have a pathway to the checkout page. Here, they possess the capability to **increase or decrease the quantity** of their items, as well as **remove them**. Moreover, they can witness the live updates on both the checkout page and the cart dropdown menu.

In addition, the application integrates **Firebase** for authentication and storage solutions. Thanks to Firebase, user authentication is facilitated through `signInWithPopup` and `signInWithEmailAndPassword`, allowing users the choice to either sign in with their Google accounts or via email and password.

Post-sign-in, a **sign-out feature** is conveniently available. Notably, all product details are diligently stored in the **Firestore Database** and fetched into the application as needed.
