# crwn-clothing
This is a beautiful and efficient, eCommerce application that is similar to Shopify. It was bulid with React, React Hooks, React Router, Context API,Firebase,styled-component and more.
It has navigation and routes which takes the users to different pages and categories of items. And for the items, the users can actually add them to the shopping cart by clicking the 'add to cart’ button, it will be displayed in the cart drop-down menu. And at the same time, the number of cart items will be updated.
From the cart drop-down menu, the users will be able to access the checkout page. From there, they can increase and decrease the quantity of the items as well as remove the items. They can also see the live changes on both our checkout page and our cart drop-down menu.
Beyond that, the application was also integrated with Firebase to handle the authentication and storage. With Firebase, we're able to authorize our users using signInWithPopup and signInWithEmailAndPassword.So the users can either sign in with Google accounts or use email and password to sign up first and then sign in.
And once the user signed in, an sign out feature was also provided. Last but not least thing I want to mention is that all the products’ details are stored in the Firestore Database and pulled into the application when used.
