This is a beautiful and efficiency ecommerce application which is similar to Shopify. It was bulid with React, React Hooks, React Router,Context API,Firebase,styled-component and more.
It has navigation and routes which takes the users to different pages and categories of items. And for the items, the users can actually add them to shopping cart by click the 'add to cart' button,it will be displayed in the cartdropdown menu. And at the same time,the number of the cart items will be updated.
From the cartdropdown menu, the users will be able to accesss the checkout page. From there, they can increase and decrease the quantity of the items as well as remove the items. They can also see the live changes in both our checkout page and our cartdropdown menu.
Beyond that, the application was also integrated with Firebase to handle the authentication and storage. With Firebase, we're able to authorize our users using signInWithPopup and signInWithEmailAndPassword.So the users can either sign in with Google accounts or use email and password sign up first then sign in.
And once the user signed in, an sign out feature was also provided.Last but not least thing I want to mention is that all the products's details are stored in the Firestore Database and pulled into application when used.
